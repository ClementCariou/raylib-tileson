# raylib-tileson

Use [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org) maps in [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/), through [Tileson](https://github.com/SSBMTonberry/tileson).

## Challenge

While this does compile and run, it requires C++17, and mixing that with C would mean needing to re-implement some of the C++ interface in C, so I'm not sure I'm convinced of the approach. Hence: https://github.com/robloach/raylib-tmx
